## Advantages of DBMS over File system

### Advantages of DBMS:

1. **Structured data**
   - DBMS stores data in a structured format of tables, rows and columns which is organized and easy to manipulate.
   - Files have unstructured data.
2. **Relationships**
   - DBMS can define relationships between tables using foreign keys.
   - Files have no relationships.
3. **Integrity**
   - DBMS enforces data integrity through constraints, checking and validation.
   - Files have no integrity checks.
4. **Security**
   - DBMS provides role-based security with users, roles and permissions.
   - File security is simple.
5. **Querying**
   - DBMS has powerful query languages like SQL.
   - Files can only be queried by reading the entire file.
6. **Transactions**
   - DBMS supports ACID transactions for consistency.
   - Files have no transactions.
7. **Backup**
   - DBMS has tools for backing up large amounts of data.
   - File backups are simple copies.

### When to use DBMS:

* For structured data that needs to be queried, analyzed and related
* When data integrity is important
* To scale to large volumes of data
* When data security is essential
* For enterprise applications that require reliability

---

### When to use file systems:

* For storing unstructured data like documents, images, audio/video
* For simple storage and retrieval, without complex queries
* For performance-critical applications where file I/O is faster
* For temporary data storage 
* For offline or disconnected access
