You are required to design a Home Security Simulator (HSS) by applying compound patterns and develop it JAVA.
There is a Duck Simulator application example in the Compound Patterns slides.

HSS has smoke and motion sensors.
These family of sensors can be manufactured by different companies.
smoke or motion is detected, an SMS message is sent to the homeowner.
This SMS message can be sent i different format, so adaptability is required.
Furthermore, if smoke is detected a water sprinkler is turned-on, and if a motion is detected an alarm is turned on.
However, turn-off capability should be provided for these devices.
Furthermore, smoke or motion detections should be logged to file controlled by a single object.
HSS main() should allow to simulate smoke & motion sensors and turning devices off.
Please provide print statements in methods to understand what your HSS is doing.
